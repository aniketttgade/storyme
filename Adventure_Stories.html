                        In "Jurassic Park," billionaire John Hammond creates a theme park filled with genetically engineered dinosaurs on a remote island off the coast of Costa Rica. To ensure the park's safety, he invites a group of experts, including paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant, paleobotanist Dr. Ellie Sattler, mathematician Dr. Ian Malcolm, and lawyer Donald Gennaro, to inspect the park before its grand opening.
                        
                        Upon arrival, the group is awestruck by the park's wonders but soon discovers that the security systems are vulnerable to sabotage. Chaos erupts when a rogue employee shuts down the park's power, allowing the dinosaurs to escape their enclosures.
